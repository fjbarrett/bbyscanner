## BBY Scanner

BBY Scanner is a barcode scanner that can detect UPCs, SKUs and QR codes in the Best Buy system. It queries the Best Buy API and displays relevant information about the product scanned, like Price and In-Store Availability. 

The project is fairly new but it officially up and running. Feel free to download and run on your own device. (Optimized for iPhone 6)
